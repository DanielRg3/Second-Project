# Second-Project: Parota del Carmen webpage

## Project Definition:
For this project, we need to create an interactive webpage with a clean User-Interface for an specific client.
In this occasion our client is **Parota del Carmen**. This client sells wooden tables and chairs, alongside with wooden accessories.
The intention is to create a webpage in which the user can review all the client inventory {Tables, Chairs, Accessories}, and the product characteristics, such as:
- Product Dimensions
- Available Colors
- Available Pater Designs
- Pricing

Finally, the user can create an account in order to introduce and store their information {Name, email, phone number, physical address}.

## Project Content:
1. Front-End:
    - Main Page {HTML & Styles}
    - Products Pages {HTML & Styles}
    - Login Page {HTML & Styles}
1. Back-End:
    - API for retailing business
    - Server to interact between the user and the Database
    - Database to store the main products information and Users accounts

## Project Learnings:
For this project we learned how to approach a client and with it *how to identify what our client **necessities** were so we could transform them into **requirements** and divide them into activities we could work on as a team!!!*

Thanks to the knowledge we obtain from the first project and the use of Zenhub we divided our activities into sprints, and we gave them target completion dates.

Finally, we worked on the individual activities:
- Front-end was once again exploited because we needed to have a good landing page for our client's products and secondary pages for the products information.
- The Back-end was a new learning in this project; We worked on the db, the models and the seeds to upload our client product information.
- We also worked on the server and the connections to interact between the front-end and the database.
- In parallel, we worked on the controllers to include all the main HTML as handlebars, the public styles, and the API to have a well consistence code.
- Important to mention, we reviewed how to add the different modules such as the Package.json, the dotenv, mysql2 and bcrypt.

## Credits:
We would like to thank our TA <cite>Fer Sosa</cite>, she helped us through the development of this project in debugging our codes mistakes, explaining us the functionality of each code section, and helping us with the look ahead activities we needed to perform in order to succeed with our project.
